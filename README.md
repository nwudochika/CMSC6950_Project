# Climate Data Analysis for Delhi, India

This project delves into a meticulous exploration of historical climate data for Delhi, India, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses key parameters like mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure, spanning from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016. The core objective involves conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a focus on time series analysis and correlation studies. Additionally, the project includes sensitivity analyses to identify extreme values and understand their temporal patterns. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure extremes will be scrutinized, and statistical tests, outlier detection methods, and impact analyses will be employed to glean meaningful insights. The README.md file serves as documentation, offering a concise overview of the project's goals, methodologies, and expected outcomes.
